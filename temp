Task 5:
So don't spend too much time summarizing.
Use most of your time explaining why it is the best solution.


Task 2:

In your response, you should give and discuss at least one reason 
to help explain why you like that type of book. It is OK to give more 
than one reason for why you like a certain type of book, but you 
should be careful not to only state a list of reasons without providing 
any explanations or details to support the reasons. 
Rather, a good approach is to try to focus on one reason and discuss it in detail.

Task 3:
In your response to this item, you should be sure to include and integrate
information from both the reading passage and the conversation.
