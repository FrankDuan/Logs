Family/Individual Sponsor
If a family member or other individual will provide your funding, your sponsor does not need to show funding 
for the entire length of your program. Instead, your sponsor must have sufficient funds for at least the 
first year of your program. These funds must be in cash (e.g., checking or savings accounts) and not subject 
to withdrawal restrictions.

If your sponsor currently has funds for just the first year, your sponsor should also submit documents showing
the means of support for the subsequent years.

Financial Support Documents

For the first year of study, a bank statement with the bankâ€™s address and phone number, indicating the date the 
account was opened and the current account balance.
Bank statements may include checking or savings accounts, certificates of deposit or money market accounts.
For each subsequent year, wage statements, statements of the value of holdings of the sponsor, investment 
account statements or other documents that provide credible evidence of the availability of funds.
Sponsors who are living in the U.S. and are not U.S. citizens must provide copies of the immigration papers 
(I-94 and visa stamp), as well as a copy of the biographical page of their passport, with the passport 
expiration date.
