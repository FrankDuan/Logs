APM

Configuration
---------------

RTL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RTL mode (Return To Launch mode) navigates Copter from its current position to hover above the home position. 
When RTL mode is selected, the copter will return to the home location. The copter will first rise to RTL_ALT 
before returning home or maintain the current altitude if the current altitude is higher than RTL_ALT. The 
default value for RTL_ALT is 15m.

RTL is a GPS-dependent move, so it is essential that GPS lock is acquired before attempting to use this mode. 
Before arming, ensure that the APMâ€™s blue LED is solid and not blinking. For a GPS without compass, the LED 
will be solid blue when GPS lock is acquired. For the GPS+Compass module, the LED will be blinking blue when 
GPS is locked.
