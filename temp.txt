Working at Huawei for more than ten years, I have acquired lots of success in CT (Communication Technology) field and helped Huawei growing up to a top telecom equipment provider. But in the recent years, when transferring to IT (Information Technology) field, I have encountered large amounts of problems. Comparing with CT, working in IT needs more creativity, agility and openness, which I’m lack in. In order to break through these bottlenecks, I’m here to apply a master degree of Computer Science in US where is the paradise of IT.
